## Part 1: Setting up Flask
__Edit app.py for this portion of the lab.__\
__This lab is the beginning of a project that we'll be building on top of every session to help practice Python, Flask and Databases..So make sure to save your code!.__\
__In this project you'll be creating an online shop of your choice!__

1. Create a basic html file in the "templates" folder, call it "home.html", this page is responsible for showing the products to the user. 

2. Go to app.py and connect the html file you just created to flask. Test it out and call us to check!
(Reminder: to see your page you should run app.py by typing "python app.py" in the terminal, then open the link that you get)


### Bonus

1. Design the "shop.html" using css and bootstrap.

2. Add a navbar. (Use w3schools.com for help if needed)



## Part 2: Routing
Create a new app route "/shop", and link it to the shop.html template from the previous part.

### Bonus
Connect shop.html and home.html together using buttons or navbars (Hint: Google "url_for")



## Part 3: Style Your Home Page
Create a list of product names and pass it to the shop.html template, have all product names show up in the shop template in order. You can make it as a basic list using div and/or br tags, in a bootstrap grid system, or even in a more advanced styling from the web. Your call, be creative!

### Bonus

1. Add prices assigned to each product and show them on shop.html accordingly. (You can do this in many ways, google it!)

2. Start creating a basic template of a product page.
